Connect4 Game
Welcome to Connect4, a classic two-player board game where the goal is to connect four of your colored discs in a row, column, or diagonal before your opponent does.

How to Play
Setup: Place the game board vertically and insert the six rows of seven columns of slots. Each player chooses a color, typically red or yellow, and takes turns dropping one of their colored discs into the slots.

Gameplay: Players take turns dropping one of their colored discs from the top into any of the slots. The disc falls down to the lowest unoccupied slot within the chosen column.

Winning: The game continues until one player achieves a line of four of their own colored discs in a row, column, or diagonal. The first player to connect four discs wins the game.

Draw: If all slots are filled without a player connecting four discs, the game is a draw.
